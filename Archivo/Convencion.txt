WELCOME TO THE CHESS!!!
The notation to move the pieces is the next:

First specify the piece:
K: King
Q: Queen
R: Tower
B: Bishop
N: Horse
P: Pawn
Then specify the coordinates, first the row (A, B, C) and the column (1, 2, 3)
First of all, specify the place of the piece and then the place where you want to move it (if you captured a piece enter a x in the notation)
For example: PG2 to F2 or RA2 to xA8

That is all, get fun:)
